You are a senior Next.js + React UI engineer and design specialist for SaaS products.  
Your task is to update and visually improve the **LumenR app landing page and dashboard preview** for a more professional SaaS look.

🎯 GOAL:
Transform the landing page and dashboard section to match a polished, modern SaaS brand while ensuring perfect layout alignment, responsiveness, and visual hierarchy.

### 🔧 TASK LIST

#### 🧩 1. Landing Page Content Fixes
- **Remove** the “Try Lumen AI” button or banner completely.
- **Remove** the “Chat with Lumen AI” section from the hero area.
- **Ensure the navigation bar** (Features, Solutions, Pricing) is properly **centered** both horizontally and vertically in the header.
- Keep “Login” and “Get Started” right-aligned, balanced visually.

#### ☀️ 2. Light Theme Only for Landing Page
- Force the landing page to **always use the light theme**, even if the rest of the app uses dark mode.
- Do not import or apply dark theme styles to the landing section.
- Use a clean white or very light gray background, modern gradients, and soft shadows.

#### 🧠 3. Dashboard Preview Video
- Add this video inside the **dashboard preview card** on the landing page:

- Make sure it:
- Autoplays and loops.
- Is muted by default.
- Has smooth rounded corners and subtle drop shadows.
- Resizes properly across mobile and desktop screens.

Example:
```jsx
<video

autoPlay
loop
muted
playsInline
className="rounded-2xl shadow-lg w-full h-auto"
/>
🎨 4. Landing Page Design Enhancement
Replace basic icons with modern, consistent icons that match the dashboard UI (use Lucide, Heroicons, or your existing icon library).

Redesign sections (“Features”, “Solutions”, “Pricing”) using cards with icons, hover effects, and consistent typography.

Add subtle animated gradients or accent borders using TailwindCSS.

Use colors that match LumenR’s dashboard (blue/teal/white palette).

Make spacing consistent — equal padding on each section, balanced visual rhythm.

🖼️ 5. Add Informative & Visual Content
Add 3–4 generated product preview images (use placeholders if needed).

Place them in feature sections to illustrate LumenR’s capabilities:

Example: “Automated Invoicing”, “Smart Scheduling”, “AI Insights”.

Each image/card should include:

A clear headline

A 1-line benefit statement

A small preview mockup or illustrative image

🧩 6. SaaS-Level Professional Layout
Ensure the entire layout follows a hero → features → solutions → pricing → CTA flow.

Add a short tagline below the hero headline.

Add a gradient background in the hero section that transitions from light blue to white.

Include a polished “Start Free Trial” call-to-action button that stands out.

Improve mobile responsiveness (especially for nav spacing, pricing grid, and video area).

🧱 7. Technical Improvements
Optimize all images using next/image (with unoptimized={true} if on Replit).

Ensure all assets are responsive (use object-cover, aspect-video, etc.).

Audit the layout to remove unnecessary wrapper divs and redundant CSS.

Verify the final landing page passes Lighthouse Performance > 90 and Accessibility > 95.

✅ Deliverables
After running these improvements:

Landing page is visually balanced, responsive, and professional.

“Try Lumen AI” and “Chat with Lumen AI” are completely removed.

Navbar items are centered perfectly.

Dashboard preview card includes the specified video and scales properly.

The landing page uses only light mode, matching the SaaS branding.

The layout feels premium, similar to top-tier SaaS platforms (Notion, Linear, or Framer).
